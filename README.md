# MyAcademicPortfolio
This is my Academic Portfolio dedicated to my subjects in BSCA, where I will be uploading my laboratory activities  I'm currently a 2nd Year BS in Computer Applications. I enjoy delving into the realm of assembly programming and mastering the art of designing my own hardware processor.
